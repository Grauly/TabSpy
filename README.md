# TabSpy
This is a small Fabric client side mod which allows a player to keep track of important players on their server, by providing a second tab-like list, which only contains players specified by a regex in the config.

## Limitations
This mod works off of the regular tab window, if something does not show up there, it cannot show up in TabSpy.
